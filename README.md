FRC_2021_Command

2021 required the team to move to the WPIlib Command-Based Framework.  This was a major last-minute rewrite of the software.

2021 started out with the comment that the robot will be exactly the same as last year's robot, except that didn't work out.

This year's bot has the following changes from last year:

Removed:
* ColorWheel
* Elevator
* Intake

Added:
* Winch
* Actuator
* Pulley
* and above mentioned architecture change
